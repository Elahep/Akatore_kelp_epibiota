fastsimcoal model scripts used to identify the best tree topology for non-uplift lineages in Durvillaea antarctica and Onithochiton neglectus.
I used these analyses to only indentify the phylogenetic relationships between non-uplift lineages of D. antarctica and O. neglectus to be later used as a "guide tree" in delimitR. I did not estimate the parameters of the models as model selection was the main purpose of these analyses.
